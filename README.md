# Welcome to Lithium Sunset!

Lithium Sunset is a free cyberpunk role-playing system born out of a need for a system that's modern, accessible, and streamlined.
The system is available on github.  The maintainers respond to pull requests.  There is a community universe that lets you write your own splat material.

## An Introduction

The Lithium Sunset roleplaying game is focused on allowing you to generate a story that takes place in a believable near-future world that has suffered under a combination of rapid social upheaval and technological development that has outpaced laws and ethics.  Like other roleplaying games, Lithium Sunset is theatre of the mind.  The sprawling forests of massive skyscrapers, the barren wastelands beyond them, and abject poverty of those caught between the two, are just a backdrop to whatever you can imagine.

With this use of imagination, the rules apply a method to generating unexpected outcomes and giving effect to the character's decisions.  Tasks that are complicated or run the risk of failure use dice rolls to determine if the outcome was successful.  Anything can happen, but circumstances and character skills and abilities make some things more likely than others.

In Lithium Sunset, players create characters who work with each other to accomplish a complex and often dangerous goal.  This goal might be to break into a Megacorp office to steal data or technology, to assassinate a target for money, or to even police and protect the neighborhood because the rent-a-cops won't go there.   It could be something else entirely.  The characters must plan, reconnoiter ```(TODO: this word is not a word that people know, apparently)```, and execute their operation, often dealing with new and unexpected challenges that arise along the way.  They could be doing the job for a fixer or a rival corporation and getting paid for it, or they could be idealists in it all for the cause.

```STORY STORY STORY TOO MUCH FUCKING 'STORY'```
One player takes the role of the Gamemaster (abbreviated GM) who operates as the storyteller and custodian of the story.  The GM is responsible for setting the stage for the story and providing obstacles for the characters to overcome.  A GM might have one character approached by an acquaintance who's friend recently disappeared under mysterious circumstances who is offering to pay for information on their whereabouts, and the players decide whether they want to take the job, and how they will complete it.  Will they go straight to the friend's home, or will they go scour the Grid first for clues?  Where do they go after?

The GM asks them to roll dice based upon the skills they want to apply, and then describes what happens.  Because the GM has the ability to react to any situation, Lithium Sunset makes for an experience that is unpredictable and open-ended.

A goal oriented narrative suggests that games might be episodic in nature, though the game does not have to have any real end.  When one goal is completed, another might begin.  Lithium Sunset takes this into account and provides a system for downtime, where characters can spend time not actively working in order to fulfill their own side-goals, such as rest and recuperation, training new skills, or crafting and maintaining their gear.

```Revisit this paragraph```
No single player ever wins or loses in Lithium Sunset, but life for a character is often loud, brutal, and short.  If a character meets its untimely demise, then the player can create a new one and be reintroduced to the group by the GM when possible.  If the group fails to accomplish their mission, but still had fun along the way, then the game was still a success!


## Have Your Cake and Eat it Too

This system is designed with the assumption that both we and you understand that it’s a mechanism for telling a story, having some fun, and spending time with friends.  We’re not going to lecture you on what we think “good” Cyberpunk is.  Obviously, this is our vision, but that doesn’t mean it has to be the only valid one.

We have included a setting and theme for convenience sake.  There is a generally anti-establishment attitude with respect to the brutally authoritarian outlook that the Corporations embrace, but if we said the only way you could play this game is by fighting that power, we’d be as bad as they were!  If you’re the gamemaster and you don’t like how something plays or sounds, take it out.  Change it.  Make it yours!

## What You Bring

To play, you need a character sheet and dice.  We will eventually have an online character creator to use, but for now, you can print one out [here]( ) (```TODO: This doesn't exist either.  Make a fucking character sheet```).  The system uses six-sided dice, often abbreviated as d6.  These are common dice that are the same ones provided in most mainstream games.  Most game mechanics will require the use two dice.  As a convenience for online players, this site includes a dice roller, but physical dice could work just as well.

The Gamemastering section includes random charts and tables that may use other dice, such as percentile dice or d20s.  These are provided for convenience and are not required to actually play the game.  If you want to use the charts but don't have the dice, we recommend a random number generator such as the excellent one available for free at [random.org](https://random.org).
