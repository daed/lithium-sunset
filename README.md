# Welcome to Lithium Sunset!

Lithium Sunset is a free cyberpunk role-playing system born out of a need for a system that's modern, accessible, and streamlined.
The system is available on github.  The maintainers respond to pull requests.  There is a community universe that lets you write your own splat material.

## An Introduction

The Lithium Sunset roleplaying game is focused on allowing you to generate a story that takes place in a believable near-future world that has suffered under a combination of rapid social upheaval and technological development that has outpaced laws and ethics.  Like other roleplaying games, Lithium Sunset is theatre of the mind.  The sprawling forests of massive skyscrapers, the barren wastelands beyond them, and abject poverty of those caught between the two, are just a backdrop to whatever you can imagine.
