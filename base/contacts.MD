# Contacts

## Who you know

**"No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."**

**- John Donne**

In this hyper-interconnected world, it's hard to go without regular contact with others.  Freelancers often require services of boutique shops and services like arms dealers, street docs, and fixers.  Often they need consulting from informants, specialists, or other freelancers.  Reliable sources are hard to establish, so tight connections to resourceful people are valued.

You begin play with 12 contact points to be split between contacts that your character would have known at the start of the game.  These people may or may not be part of your character's backstory.  You may buy up to 4 contacts with these points. 

## What they know

Contacts are npcs who are friends, dealers, fixers, or some other well-connected person that knows the player's character.  They should have names, personalities, and backstories much as the player characters do.

Typically, Contacts will not require a full character sheet.  If they are going to be involved in combat or if they are going to be required to make active skill checks or if the game would otherwise benefit from having a full character sheet for a contact, then it is a good idea, but otherwise they should only use the two stats on the character sheet:  Relationship and Influence.

Relationship is how well the player's character and the contact are getting along.  The max is 5, which indicates that they are extremely close or that the contact owes the character a major favor.  The minimum is -5, which indicates that the player character is either hated by the contact, or owes the contact a major favor.  At 0, the contact knows the player character but is completely indifferent toward them.

### Contacting Contacts

Sara Tonen threw herself onto her couch and watched her world go fuzzy for a second as the trode-net over her hair bounced and resettled in place.  Once her eyes refocused, she opened a vidchat with Stefan, a wageslave who works at the regional corporate surveying office.  *With any luck, he'd be able to find her the blueprints for the office*, she thought.  A square popped up in the corner of her vision with his face in it.  His name appeared below.  "Hey Stefan, what're you doing tomorrow night?", she asked.  

"Sara, it's been ages!  Whacha got in mind?"  *He sounded tired, but excited.  Good.*  

"A friend of mine and I got into an argument today about the city," she lied, "I wanted to ask you a few questions and prove to her she's wrong.  Let's meet at the Bedlam.  I'll buy you a couple beers!"

"Twisted my arm.  I can be there at twenty-hour." *The poor guy would have cut off his arm if she just asked him politely to do so.*  

"Thanks, see ya' then," she smiled.

Influence represents how capable the Contact is in whatever their specific expertise is and ranges from 1 to 10.  A fixer with more points in influence can provide better services, including more reliable information and better paying jobs.  A dealer might have better weapons and faster delivery of custom gear.  When needing to determine if a Contact can do something, add this value to whatever to the die roll when making the test.

Included below is a list of contact types.  You may also create your own if there isn't an appropriate type for your contact's expertise.

|type | examples |
|------------|-----------------|
|Dealer|                |
|Fixer|              |
|Decker |           |
|Doctor  |                |
|Expert  |                |
|Mercenary |              |

## Getting Help

Getting help from a Contact typically involves meeting somewhere.  In some cases this can be done over the Grid, but sometimes an in-person meeting is a better way to conduct business.  

Generally most services more complex than a sympathetic ear are provided for a price.  A character in desperate need can call upon a favor from the Contact, who may consider it if it is a reasonable request.  However, your relationship degrades until you find a way to "make it up to them".

When it comes time to see if the Contact is capable of providing the request, roll an Influence Test, with the Test difficulty on the chart below.

|Description |Examples | Test Difficutly |
|------------|---------|--------|
|inconsequential |common dealer stock, asking to meet, basic questions| 5 |
|straightfoward |special orders, getting decent jobs, basic research | 7  |
|difficult |custom orders, finding the good jobs, intermediate research, decking | 10 |
|complex and dangerous| works of art, field-changing research, discovering deeply buried secrets|>=15|

## Helping them

Your contacts are people too, and thus have their own ambitions and desires.  Helping them will improve their influence, which will mean that there are more services available, and can also improve your relationship with them.  This is the essential means of recovering your friendship from having asked for a favor.

(GMs:  This can be treated as a means of generating potential jobs to perform, should a contact ask a favor the character cannot refuse, then they may need to recruit an entire team to take care of the task.)


## Example contacts

These characters are example contacts.  They exist at whatever power level is listed, and when selecting one, pay the cost listed and one additional contact point per relationship level you would like to have with the contact (max 3 for new characters).  You then 'know' this character and may contact them for services, advice, or help.

#### Johnny Carcinogen
**Real Name:** Johnathan O'Toole
**Grid Handle:** Johnny Carcinogen
**Male, age 34**
**Contact cost:** 3 + relationship points
**Influence:** 2

Johnny is a street punk who never wanted more than to play in his band and chase his next fix.  His band, *Nikola Tesla Versus the Edison Deathbots*, was a one-hit wonder that has been unsuccessfully trying to make their way back onto the charts.  Until that happens, he pays for life by selling drugs on the side.

Johnny is frequently available, assuming he's not too strung out to respond, and almost always has access to street drugs or common pharmaceuticals.  He will also buy stolen grid gear or recording equipment.  Music is the only topic that interests him and he is willing to discuss it to no end.

Beyond being a drug dealer and knowing how to have a good time, he doesn't offer many other services, but he probably knows someone who has what you're looking for if you have a few credits to offer for his time.

#### RIPOSTExMODERN
**Real Name:**  Rafael Milosh
**Grid Handle:** RIPOSTExMODERN
**Male, Age 35**
**Contact cost:** 5 + relationship points
**Influence:** 4

Rafael is a decker with a certain amount of renown.  They say he survived getting brain-crashed by ICE three times.  He claims the secret to his success is that he synchronizes music to his heartbeat.  The doctors are not so sure.

Rafael is in it for the cause.  He blames corporations for the environmental destruction that ruined his hometown, and now works to expose and stop their continued damage to what's left of the world.  Rafael will always consider helping any Freelancer who is trying to stop a corporation from causing harm to the environment.  In these cases, treat your relationship with him as being one higher than it is.

His primary expertise is in Decking, though he also designs a lot of his own gear.  He appreciates Hip and Durable audio equipment, grid gear, and cyberdecks.  Cheap or Poorly Constructed gear is wasteful and irritates him.  His speciality knowledge is music.

#### Sara Tonen
**Real Name:** Sara Fuller
**Grid Handle:** Sara Tonen
**Female, age 27**
**Contact cost:** 5 + relationship points
**Influence:** 3

Sara had a great job designing expensive grid gear for Slate Corporation until her boss started getting handsy.  After losing her job for putting him in the infirmary, she put her connections and grid skills to the service of the Freelance underworld as a fixer and information broker.  It wasn't much longer until she met Zeven and they started working together, with Zeven the brawn and Sara the brains.

Sara wants to make a difference in the world where she can.  She's no saint, but she helps out with charity cases and gives back to the neighborhood where she can.  Anyone taking a job from her can turn down some of the payment and she will reliably make sure that the money gets it way back into the hands of the needy.  She is impressed by Hip gear and clothing, but only hates Cheap or Poorly Constructed gear if it is Counterfeit. 

She is a competent fixer and a skilled information broker, and always knows where to find high-quality grid hardware.  

(Developer's note:  Sara's contact cost is one higher than normal for her influence because she's capable of performing more roles than most contacts.)

#### Zeven
**Real Name:** Zeven Butler
**Grid Handle:** zerebous7
**Female, age 24**
**Contact cost:** 4 + relationship points
**Influence:** 3

Zeven is a hard as nails Freelance mercenary who grew up on the streets of Chicago.  She spent most of her life bouncing from gang to gang up until she met Sara Tonen at a club one night.  Sara Tonen talked her out of the gang life and into doing mercenary work over drinks, and soon the two were inseparable in their work.

Zeven only cares about three things, herself, her job, and Sara Tonen.  She doesn't necessarily want to see anyone hurt, but she's not going to let that stop her if that's what it takes to protect any of those three.  She's got a prosthetic right leg from an accident with an explosive from back in her gang days.  She's typically impressed by big guns, Overt Armor, and Bulletproofed gear.  She thinks Poorly Constructed gear is a sign of an amateur, and she doesn't like liars.

Her primary expertise is in Firearms and combat.  She also still maintains a few contacts in the underworld and is a reliable source of both illicit goods and information.  She is hirable for mercenary work at 200 credits an hour plus expenses.
