# Combat

## Rules of Engagement

## Turns

Combat is divided into turns during which each participant gets to act once.  A turn is 10 seconds long in the game world.  The GM should have each player declare their actions.  This doesn't need to be done in any particular order, and players can be skipped and come back to if they need more time to decide.

After each player has declared their actions, the GM should then describe the outcome, asking players to roll skill tests or attacks as needed.

## Attacking

There are a few basic steps to any combat:

  1. Declare target and whether the attack is a 'called shot'.
  2. Roll an attack test with the chosen weapon
  3. Target can choose to dodge or parry
  4. Apply modifiers and check if test passed difficulty
  5. Determine where the hit lands

### Determining if you hit
To see if a character hits with a weapon, first declare whether you are making a regular shot or a called shot (as well the location you are aiming for).  Next, roll a test using the corresponding ability and weapon skill.  The base difficulty for this test is 9, and is modified by the rules below.

### Artful dodging
The targeted character can actively attempt to avoid getting hit.  They can do this by rolling dice as a Parry (Strength) test (requires an object held to parry with) or a Dodge (Dexterity) test (requires nearby cover, or to drop to the ground).  Use the outcome of this roll as the base difficulty for the attackers.  If the attacker rolls it or higher, it’s a hit!

### Never saw it coming

If a target is both, not threatened and also completely unaware of the attacker's presence, then the attacker will do two points of damage on a successful hit instead of one.  This damage can be reduced by armor or other effects.

### Other bonuses and penalties


|Circumstance  | modifier|
|----------------|----|
|More than 50 feet away|-1 (per 50 ft)
|Less than 20 feet away|+1
|At least 50% of the target is not visible|-1
|Target is in darkness or dim light|-1
|Target is lying prone|-1
|Firing a called shot|-2




### Determining where you hit
To determine what hitbox is damaged, roll 2d6 and compare the chart for your attack type:

### Called Shot

A called shot is different than a regular shot.  Hitting even in spite of the penalty means the character hit <i>somewhere</i> on the target.  It may not have been where you intended, but it's more likely that it was.

Roll 2d6 and consult the chart below.  If your roll matches the called location, then you hit that hitbox.  If the roll doesn't match, then it becomes a torso shot.

**Regular Attack:**

| 2d6 roll |Hitbox location |
|-----|----------------|
|2-3  | Head 
|4    | Left Arm
|5-6 | Left Leg
|7-8 | Torso
|9-10| Right Leg
|11  | Right Arm
|12  | Groin
</div>
<div markdown="1">
**Called Shot:**

| 2d6 roll |Hitbox location* |
|-----|----------------|
|10-12  | Head 
|9-12 | Any Arm
|9-12 | Any Leg
|11-12 | Groin

\* If roll doesn’t match the called location, the torso is hit instead.
</div>
</div>
That location is then hit by the weapon and does whatever damage is listed in the weapons profile, first to whatever armor the targeted character is wearing in that location, and then to the character itself.  Most weapons deal a single point of damage, though certain weapons may do more damage under certain circumstances.
