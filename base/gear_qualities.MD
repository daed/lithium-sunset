# Gear Qualities

Many items often have one or more qualities associated with them.  These are characteristics that are important to be aware of as they describe quirks or important features that have in-game effects.

#### Bulletproof

Bulletproof objects are designed to take a hit and keep going.  A bulletproof object isn’t broken the first time it is shot by a firearm.  A bulletproof object that then takes a subsequent hit becomes broken as normal. 

#### Cheap

This item is a notoriously cheap model.  It looks cheap, it feels cheap, and it is covered in cheap brand logos.  There’s a particular scene out there for this kind of look, but it’s probably going to leave most people unimpressed.

#### Durable

Durable objects have been ruggedized.  They are never at risk of breaking from even large drops and are almost entirely Waterproof.  They are not Bulletproof (unless otherwise specified) but they’re close.  They’re not lightweight, but they will last and they feel solid.  Durable items can be used as improvised weapons without breaking.

#### High-maintenance

High-maintenance equipment requires a lot of adjustment and tends to be temperamental.  Any time a roll of 2 or 3 comes up on a skill test using a high-maintenance item, then the GM determines some way in which the equipment glitches out.  Generally this should be something distracting or annoying, but not necessarily debilitating.

#### Hip

THIS is the thing to have right now!  It is IN.  It’s been the thing since ```<celebrity name>``` started usi-- oh nevermind, she just got a new one.  It’s so yesterday.

Hip items impress most people.  They’re expensive, well-designed, and carry a solid look that is timeless.  Completely timeless… until it’s not.  After you have owned this item for a month, it loses the attribute hip.

#### Illegal

This object is illegal in most of the corporate world.  The only way you can legally possess this item is by having a license for it, which requires either corporate sponsorship or a good fake. 

#### Monitored

This low-cost equipment is secretly subsidized by monitoring the usage of the device and then the manufacturers sell that data to other corporations.  When you use a monitored device, there is always a paper trail somewhere of what you did while using it.

#### Overt

This gear is not subtle.  Whenever using it for its intended purpose, it is almost impossible to conceal.  Overt Armor won’t fit under any other clothes without looking suspicious.  Overt Electronics are bulky, make noise, and set off alarms.  There is no staying under the radar once Overt gear is in play.

#### Poor-Construction

However much you paid for this, it was too much.  It might not even have been Cheap, but it’s flimsy and the corner is already snapped and it just barely works.  If you drop it, it’ll break.  If the hitbox it’s in (i.e. something in your hand or on your face) takes damage, it’ll break.  If it gets more than a tiny bit wet, it will break.  

#### Unavailable

During all normal circumstances (and most exceptional ones) this is something that exists, but you can’t get one.  This just isn’t for sale anywhere, for any amount of money.

#### Waterproof

Waterproof objects have been certified to IP77 standards and may be submerged for up to 20 hours in water no more than 20 feet deep.
