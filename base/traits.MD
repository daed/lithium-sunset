# Traits

Players acquire traits that are modifiers on the character that represent physical changes, social obligations, or karmic fluctuations.  Traits can be bought (during character creation or advancement) or earned.  Some traits provide bonuses or alter abilities.  Not all traits are positive though, and they include negative qualities such as missing limbs or other lingering malalignments.  You may select a positive quality at character start.

### Positive Traits

These are in no way complete, just ideas.
