# So You Wanna Be Your Own Person

You do work for the highest bidder.  You might have standards or you might not, but your neighbors certainly hope you do.  You work "infrequent and odd" jobs, just as needed.

In reality, you're a professional agent performing corporate theft and sabotage.  Some people work for money, and some people work for a cause.  Regardless of what motivates you, you found a job.  This was either through a friend of a friend, or an anonymous Grid board, or maybe even because you found a piece of paper under a rock with instructions scribbled on it.  Regardless, it is what you've decided to do.

## What does it pay?

Depends on the job.  And not all jobs are valued equally.  Typically the overall payout of a job depends on how good your fencer is. (**TODO:** insert bit about GM needing to be fair to players but its' their decision ultimately.  In gamemastering section, make a payout/challenge rating estimator)

## Why would I do it?

That's up to you, but you're risking life and limb, so you better have a good reason.  Is it just for the money?  Is it for a higher purpose?  Is it personal?  These motivations are important as they reflect the drive of your character, and should be integral in the character's personality.  (**TODO:** make motivations be a game mechanic like something similar to white wolf?  maybe reward experience or verve?)

## How does it work?

You just contact your friendly neighborhood fixer about work who will arrange a meeting between you and a prospective client.  You'll meet with the client and they will explain the details of the job to you, and you'll agree on a payment.  You'll load up with all the knowledge you need to complete the job and everything will turn out great in the end with you getting paid in full and on time.  And that's about the time you wake up and realize that you took three bullets during the job and then the fixer stiffed you and left you for dead.

In reality things don't *always* go bad, but something tends to go wrong in even the best laid plans, and improvisation and flexibility in the plan make or break the success of the job.  When this happens, alarms go off, doors turn into walls, and gunfights break out.
