# Character Creation

```NOTE: This is a basic method of generating a average character, fresh faced and ready to go.  This character creation process is a little static, but I will hopefully be able to improve on it as time goes on. ```

## Bonus Points

All characters have 5 bonus points.  They may spend these freely throughout the character creation process to further customize their characters beyond the defaults.  Rules for using them will be detailed in each section.

#### Attributes

All characters start with 19 points to allocate between attributes.  They may do this as they see fit, though they cannot have more than one attribute outside of the 2-4 range.

One attribute may be increased for 4 bonus points.  This increase may raise an attribute above 4 regardless of the above rule.  This selection may only be taken once regardless of the number of bonus points a character might have.

#### Action Skills

All character start with 10 active skill points.  A character can distribute these skill points between skills however they wish, though they must abide by the ability score cap.

Bonus points may be spent on additional skill points at a rate of 1 bonus point for 1 skill point.  These increases may only be in skills that already have at last one skill point in them.  Up to 5 bonus points may be spent this way.

#### Knowledge Skills

All characters may start with 4 Knowledge skills.  Each Knowledge skill selected at character creation starts with 2 ranks.  These skills may be increased in the game later on.

In addition, a character may select a single language knowledge skill to be their native tongue.  This is a knowledge skill for them with 4 points in it.

Bonus points may be spent on additional skill points at a rate of 1 bonus point for 1 skill point.  Unlike Action Skills, new knowledge skills may be purchased in this way, though they only start at rank 1.  Up to 5 bonus points may be spent this way.

#### Traits

A character may select a single positive trait from the ones allowed from the Traits section.  

A character may gain 5 bonus points by selecting a negative trait from the ones allowed.  This may only happen once.

A second positive trait may be purchased for 5 bonus points.  This selection may only be taken once regardless of the number of bonus points a character might have.

#### Money

A character starts with 20000 credits worth of gear.  Up to 2000 credits may be kept from this amount.  Any unspent credits beyond that are lost.

Bonus points may be spent on additional credits at a rate of 200 credits per bonus point.  Credits bought this way do not count toward the 2000 credit limit above.
