##### CQB Arms Security Softshell
This durable and lightweight jacket is designed for security guards who patrol and man public areas.  It has the word “SECURITY” emblazoned across it in multiple locations in bright, easily identifiable colors.  It contains a ballistic weave of synthetic blends that is designed to resist impacts.  This jacket immediately identifies the wearer superficially as a member of some security team, somewhere.  Typically this will not work out in the wearer’s favor as they will draw the attention of bystanders but at the same time the jacket alone will not hold up to scrutiny as proper identification as a member of any specific security detail.

When wearing one, the first wound to the chest or either arm hitbox has the damage reduced by one (minimum one).  This reduction may be applied twice before the jacket is too damaged to be of any further use.

### What's in a name?

The relentless advertising of the 20th century escalated further in the 21st, with ads becoming invasive to a degree only imagined by yesterday's corporate marketing staff.  The denizens of the Perpetual Age are "hyper-brand aware" and "marketing positive" (or that's what the corp drones keep saying) so branding is included on items here as a convenience.  These are some of the more popular versions of this gear, but when a product shows viability, it's not unusual for a competitor to start making their own version of it.  Even beyond that, entire industries exist just dedicated to producing replicas of a product once it becomes popular enough.  

If you decide that you want something made by a different brand, like a VIP Longcoat made by AEGIS instead of Defiance Tech, it is not any more difficult to find.
</div>

##### Defiance Technologies VIP Longcoat
This stylish overcoat is constructed out of a silk-nylon polymer that stiffens in reaction to kinetic force, making it an ideal choice of coats for executives, politicians, and criminals.

When wearing one, the first wound to any hitbox except the head has the damage received reduced by one (minimum one).  This reduction may be applied four times before the coat is too damaged to provide further protection.  It is one of the lightest armors available, but it won’t slow you down and most places consider them upscale attire, if a little showy.

##### Kevlar Armor
Kevlar Armor is any of the variants of low-tech military surplus armor mass-produced after the Afghan war era of the early 2000s and prior to the Schism War of 2047.  The armor consists of bullet-resistant plating integrated into panels of ballistic nylon with MOLLE attachment points allowing for pouches and equipment to be modularly attached to the armor as desired.  Versions of it can be found in virtually any color or camouflage pattern, though “coyote tan” and “police grey” remain the most popular.

Kevlar armor provides +1 hitpoint to the torso, groin, and both arm hitboxes while it is being worn.  As it does not provide leg armor, it does not slow the user down in spite of its additional weight.

##### AEGIS Combat Armor Mk2
The AEGIS Combat armor is a modularized set of lightweight armor that the AEGIS Arms corporation developed and produced during the Schism War.  This armor uses a tangle of graphene strands to catch bullets and dissipate their energy similar to how traditional flak armor works, but with less weight and bulk.  This allowed for the construction of full-body armor that only somewhat hampers speed and range of movement.  Customization is possible through legacy MOLLE attachments as well as newer electromag fixtures. The armor can be ordered from AEGIS (if you have the right credentials) in any color or variety of styles, though anyone buying it from a third party dealer would most likely find it in the black or grey colors of special forces units.

AEGIS Combat Armor provides +3 hitpoints to every hitbox except the head.  A character wearing it receives half of their total bonus (rounded down) to any physical activity that requires a full range of motion or prolonged exertion, such as running a marathon, performing a backflip, or performing surgery.  Individual panels of AEGIS Combat Armor are designed to be replaced once they wear out, and the price listed is the base price for a replacement hitbox’s worth of armor.

##### Defiance Technologies Full Metal Hazard Armor
It’s goddamned tank armor, okay?  It’s a pain in the ass to use, but it’s indestructible.


### Grid Gear
Various electronics are required to use the Grid.  They are listed by category below.

#### Comsticks

Comsticks are lightweight devices that come in many shapes and sizes.  They enable a person to use basic network services.  Most also provide various ports for the accessories needed to join the Grid, including electrodes and gloves.

Depending on the price range, manufacturer, and intended purpose, they might come as a small pocket-sized panel, a wristwatch, or a similar device.  They’ll typically have built-in features including at least one camera, a flashlight, speakers, and a microphone array.  More expensive specialized versions exist that come with mount points, are integrated into goggles/glasses, or are even cybernetic implants, though the implants are harder to replace or upgrade.

The basic network services that are available vary with the corporation that provides the network services, but almost all of them offer access to time, weather, Persona services, and communication via text, video, or voice.

A basic expectation is that a person will have one with them, somewhere.  A person without one might be viewed as extremely poor or backward.  A person with several would be viewed suspiciously without some sort of explanation.

Comsticks operate wirelessly, but they also have less throughput and processing power compared to cyberdecks.  A character can only perform the Operate, Sift, or Defy action skills when connected through a comstick.  They are also more insulated from the signal, so Crashing is very unpleasant, but seldom dangerous.

|Gear|Qualities|Price|
|----|---------|-----|
|Norelco Smoothtalker|Cheap, poor construction, monitored|5000c|
|Toshiba Cybercommunicator II|Cheap|10,000c|
|Panasonic Commtech| | 30,000c|
|CQB Arms Inquest|Waterproof, durable, bulletproof|100,000c|
|Slate Datawatch| Waterproof, durable, hip|100,000c|

#### Cyberdecks

Whereas Comsticks are full-featured devices that set out to be able to do everything, a cyberdeck is a much more specialized device.  Usually a Cyberdeck is a box weighing a few pounds with an access point jack, an uplink jack, and a power jack, all fitted with retractable cables.  Typically sold as “Grid Full-Sense Simulation Units”, cyberdecks are designed to be connected to a user’s datajack to interface directly into their brain.  Deckers will then remove or bypass the physical safeguards on the device to replace the extremely limited full-sense software with their own custom operating systems.  This links the brain of the user with the Grid and allows them to experience the Grid as if it was a physical location in which they were actually standing.

The senses are all aware of nodes of the Grid in calibration with the user’s settings.  Searching and scrolling through data is as natural as moving one’s body.  Communication is as natural as speaking aloud, typing, or even writing.  Crashing is violent and often painful.

Cyberdecks must be physically connected to a datajack to function.  They must also connect into a fiber-optics Grid Access Point.  Most have an internal battery of some sort that can last a few hours, though in order to function for a prolonged span of time they must also be plugged into a power receptacle.  Some models of cyberdeck offer an integrated comstick which gives them a wireless mode, but the limited throughput of wireless mode means that the function of the cyberdeck is limited to the capabilities of the comstick.

|DIY Frankendeck|Cheap, high-maintenance|50,000c|
|Panasonic Grid Dervish ST-2|High-maintenance|150,000c|
|Defiance Technologies DataMonitor MK.b|Waterproof, durable, bulletproof|250,000c|
|Phillips GridGuard One|Waterproof, durable, hip|300,000c|

<div class="sidebar" markdown="1">
### Cyberdeck Mods
These are special ways of getting modifications put onto any existing cyberdeck.  The price listed is in addition to the cost of the cyberdeck itself.
|Special modifications|Qualities|Price|
|---------------------|-----|---|
|Add bulletproof to cyberdeck|Bulletproof|100,000c|
|Add hip to cyberdeck (must not be cheap)|Hip|70,000c|
</div>

##### DIY Frankendeck
You spent weeks scrounging the parts for a deck of your own, and now you’ve finally got it put together.  Sure, the case is Panasonic, the processor is Toshiba, and the neural interface IBM, but it belongs to you.   It’s just as good as any other Cyberdeck (aside from the fact that you need to take it apart once a week to clean it to keep it from overheating).

SPECIAL: A character can elect to invest some cash into their Frankendeck by getting some designer aftermarket components and improving their style.  These upgrades cost 75,000 credits.  In doing this, the Frankendeck loses the cheap quality.

SPECIAL:  A character can elect to upgrade their DIY Frankendeck by taking time to diagnose and replace trouble components, upgrade the fans, and checke seals and heatsinks.  These upgrades cost 125,000 credits.    In doing this, the Frankendeck loses the high-maintenance quality.

#### Accessories
Accessories are used to augment the function of a Comstick or Cyberdeck.

##### Comstick Node Interfaces
This consists of hepatic gloves, goggles, and a net of electrodes that is usually sold together as a set that is used to join the Grid via a comstick.  Hundreds of companies offer their own take on this hardware, and they generally advertise it as a lifestyle, not a product.

The quality of the equipment typically tracks with the amount spent on it.  The cheapest models offer thin materials and low-resolution sensors, whereas the nicer ones are usually made from high-quality metals and offer RealLife™ sensors and Iris™ displays, which are claimed to be certified to a specific level of quality.  Military/Professional grade options offer unusual features and form factors that go above and beyond basic specification and are designed to be bulletproof, impact resistant, and survive harsh environments and weather.


|Gear|Qualities|Price|
|----|---------|-----|
|Interface gear, cheap|Cheap, poor construction, monitored|4000c|
|Interface gear, average| |10000c|
|Interface gear, high end|Waterproof, hip|20000c|
|Interface gear, military replica|Waterproof, durable|20000c|
|Interface gear, military-issue|Waterproof, durable, bulletproof|40000c|

##### Headphones
These come in various flavors from discrete pieces that fit into the ear canal to large over-ear studio headsets.  Many come with microphones, noise-cancelation, and other quality enhancement controls, though most people select them based on aesthetics or brand awareness, rather than features.


|Gear|Qualities|Cost|
|----|---------|----|
|Headphones, cheap|Cheap, poor construction, monitored|1000c|
|Headphones, average| |8000c|
|Headphones, high end|Waterproof, hip|20,000c|
|Headphones, military-issue|Waterproof, durable, bulletproof|40,000c|

##### Defense Barriers
These expensive and highly illegal pieces of hardware sit in between a datajack and cyberdeck and protect the user from the physical harm or invasion a malicious attacker would inflict upon them.  Most are fashioned to be a large collar that sits on the neck or a module that hangs directly off of a user’s datajack.  Due to the computational power required, they are bulky and difficult to conceal while being used.

By constantly scanning the signal and running code on a simulated ‘brain’, they can detect undesired output and terminate the connection often before permanent damage or death occurs.  Being disconnected in this way always results in a Dumpshock (Will) test, though failures won’t cause permanent damage.

As comsticks and unmodified Simulation Units already have safeguards built into them, carrying one of these around almost immediately identifies a person as a decker.  Virtually all authorities across the world consider possession of these tools illegal, and will punish a user in accordance with jurisdiction.  This is often incarceration at a minimum.  Licensing for such tools is frequently available to registered security and military professionals on an as-needed basis.

The quality of the defense barrier determines how much damage can get through before the defense barrier engages and disconnects the wearer.  A defense barrier is a Node can be noticed and Cracked, though by design they are difficult to observe.

|Gear|Qualities|Price|

|Defiance Technologies Headcase Electrostatic Discharge Barrier|Illegal, overt|500,000c|

### Infrastructure

#### Node Relay
This device uses sophisticated sternographic protocols to conceal the origin of node traffic at the cost of additional latency.   A user who knows both the location and has been granted access to the relay may choose to log in to it.  After they log in, all traffic from the user appears to be coming from the relay; not the user’s location.  This technology is much maligned by corporations and security forces but is not illegal in most places yet.

#### Server
A server is a piece of hardware that connects to an access point and creates a location on the Grid.  Servers may be public, unlisted, or by Persona white-list.  The server itself is typically registered to a Persona under the Extrajudicial Grid License Agreement, though loopholes allow for most organizations and administrators to avoid using Personas with their own personal information.

Understanding the scale of a server is difficult as it depends on configuration and extra software packages, but generally most servers will offer enough space to create a space up to 1 km^3.  Optimizations and farms of servers allow for larger locations, but this is the most practical size.  Servers can be rented and hosted in well protected data centers or (for the more paranoid) they can be wired into access points at home, unsuspecting chain diners, the office, or anywhere else that may allow grid connections without asking too many questions, but this too is not without potential scrutiny.

#### ICE
ICE are software packages that protect server nodes from attack.  They come in two flavors typically:  White ICE which will identify and report intruders to a security organization (usually Defiance or AEGIS) before disconnecting their targets, and the dangerous black ICE that instead Crash intruders by exploiting the same lack of safeguards that deckers themselves use to manipulate the Grid.
