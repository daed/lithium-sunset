# Hazards of Life

These are a few commonplace hazards one might encounter while on the job.

## Scorcher

*The weather has not become less inclement in the Perpetual Age.  This isn't a good day to be outside.  Even in the shade, it's well over 40&deg;C (100&deg;F).  Better grab some vids and popcorn and stay in today if you can.*

Scorchers are common, but the probability varies depending on region.  When outside for more than a consecutive half hour in a Scorcher, a character must make an ```Endurance (Fortitude) 7``` test.  This test must be repeated every half hour, with the difficulty increasing by one each time.  Getting out of the heat for at least 20 minutes will reset the difficulty, assuming the character has not already failed a test.

The first time a character fails a test, then they suffer a -1 penalty on all tests afterward as they begin to feel the effects of dehydration and overexposure.  The second time they fail a test, they may only apply half of their total modifier (rounded down) to future tests.  If the character fails a third Endurance test, then they fall unconscious.  If they fail a fourth test, then they die.

Note that specific items may help counter these effects as stated on the item description.
