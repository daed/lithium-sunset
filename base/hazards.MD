# Hazards of Life

These are a few commonplace hazards one might encounter while on the job.

## Scorcher

*The weather has not become less inclement in the Perpetual Age.  This isn't a good day to be outside.  Even in the shade, it's well over 40&deg;C (100&deg;F).  Better grab some vids and popcorn and stay in today if you can.*

Scorchers are common during the day, but the odds of having one varies depending on region and what season it is, if you're lucky enough to live in a place that still has those.  When outside for more than a consecutive half hour in a Scorcher, a character must make an ```Endurance (Fortitude) 7``` test.  This test must be repeated every half hour, with the difficulty increasing by one each time.  Getting out of the heat for at least 20 minutes will reset the difficulty, assuming the character has not already failed a test.

The first time a character fails a test, then they suffer a -1 penalty on all tests afterward as they begin to feel the effects of dehydration and overexposure.  The second time they fail a test, they may only apply half of their total modifier (rounded down) to future tests.  If the character fails a third Endurance test, then they fall unconscious.  If they fail a fourth test, then they die.

Note that specific items may help counter these effects as stated on the item description.

## Twister

## Malign Reality Breakdown

*Something strange is going on with reality.  At first, people thought it was just bullshit.  But then it started happening more.  Strange events that don't make sense are happening with increasing regularity.  There were easy explanations in the beginning.  It was called false memories.  The Mandela effect.  Misinformation and "fake news".  Hoaxes and conspiracy, even.  Now at least one corporation is calling it live phenomenon and studying its effects and possible causes.*

A malign reality breakdown is when something that seems obvious doesn't turn out the way it seems like it was supposed to.  It could be a series of events where a piano is dropped on a person's head, yet no harm comes to them.  Or a person walks around a corner, and not only disappears from view, but reality itself.  

More often these events are subtle and less violent than that:  One of the most prominent examples of this effect is the classic holovid *Sinbad*, which a former basketball player is said to have played a sailor and adventurer from ancient Baghdad.  The holovid doesn't exist, and the only record of it ever having existed lies in the hundreds of Grid users who insist that it did.  

The explanations range from mass insanity to a large group joke.  Some of the believers claim that it may have been from an alternate reality or that its disappearance was the plot of Disney-AOLTimeWarner to rerelease it again as an entirely new movie.  Some have even suggested that it was destroyed by time-travelers.

Regardless of the cause, a malign reality breakdown leaves a sense of disquiet among the unnaturally perceptive.  An ```Intuition (Wits)``` or a ```Recall (Will)``` test may be attempted to detect such a breakdown (see sidebar for difficulty).  A character with an Insanity trait may reroll their dice on their test to notice the event occurring.  These events may actually be beneficial to characters as well as a hinderance, though as a general rule, they should be dangerous and indiscriminate when they do strike.  Any character in the presence of such an event as it occurs should make a ```Resist Fear (Fortitude)``` test or be filled with the sudden and distracting urge to leave the area, even if they're uncertain of the reason why.

Designer's note:  These events exist as a means to offer explanation to a character's use of verve, as well as to provide a GM with the opportunity to alter the course of events for dramatic tension and flair.  They should be used sparingly unless the goal is a "cosmic horror" theme, and there are probably better suited systems for that.

## Toxic Gas

Pollutants are a very common thing in the Perpetual Age, and they come in many forms.  A common one is toxic gasses, which range from pollution to radioactive dust clouds.

## High Voltage


## Machinery


## Active Security
