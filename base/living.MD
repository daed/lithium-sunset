## Lifestyles of the Poor and Ethically Questionable

You're not doing this because you're an independently wealthy board member of a corporation.  You're doing this because you have two weeks before rent is due and you don't have enough credits to buy a cup of soycaf.  Maybe it's even worse than that, but maybe not.  Yeah, you might be getting by.  Your situation might even be average, but it isn't good.  Even if it is, you're still only one more unexpected calamity away from becoming those you most fear or pity.

This section will cover the rules for lifestyles, and the benefits thereof.  It will also cover currency, both mechanically and thematically.

## The Corporate Credit

- Corporation owned
- Secure digital currency

## Resources

On your character sheet, you don't count individual credits.  Instead you keep track of resources.  Resources represent availability of the liquid assets needed to buy goods and services and the time involved in making use of them.

You also have a lifestyle.  A lifestyle costs a certain amount of resources every month.  Your rent, food, entertainment, and weapon maintenance all cost you for however well you'd like to live.  The following describe various lifestyles that are available to your character.  If it falls in the description, then you don't need to pay any additional resources to do it.

**Excellent:**  You have a nice enough home in an attractive and safe part of town.  Maybe you're in one of the nicer Portland Arcohabs, or maybe in a condo on the upscale part of Chicago.  You have the time to remain active and learn new things.  You likely have multiple forms of private transportation, and can keep them in working order.  If something breaks, you fix it without thought.  If there's something trivial you want, you buy it without question.  Cost:  15 resources / month

**Average:**  Your apartment is a cramped place in a reasonably safe part of town.  Maybe you share it with a roommate.  You have reasonable transportation and can reliably get around quickly.  Food is affordable.  Availability of equipment is high. Cost: 10 resources / month

**Destitute:**  The place that you are living in is not in a great neighborhood.  Best case you have running water.  Maybe its a storage container or a capsule hotel.  You are one bad situation away from being out on the street.  All your expenses need to be carefully accounted for.  You probably don't have a vehicle and rely on public transportation to get around in most cases.  Cost 3 resources / month

**Free:**  You sleep were you can out on the streets.  Sometimes it's a tent in an alley, other times its an abandoned building.  Basic necessities are time consuming and inconvenient to get.  Your possessions don't ever grow beyond what you can carry, at least not for very long.  You could probably manage a bus ride somewhere, but not many more than one.  Travel is generally inconvenient.  Freedom like a shopping cart.  Cost: 0 resources / month

The starting lifestyle is destitute.  At any point during character creation onward, a player may choose for their character's lifestyle to increase.  This costs an immediate payment of the next level's number of resources.   For example, the cost to go to Average from Destitute is 5 credits, and then another 10 credits to go up to Excellent.  This consumes 3 weeks in downtime while the character finds a new location, moves their stuff, buys a car, or whatever else the character is doing to improve their lifestyle.  Note that the full amount for the new lifestyle is due again still at the end of the month.

For each thing you do in a lifestyle above your own, it adds 2 to the lifestyle cost for that month.  For example, A destitute character who wants to keep a vehicle fueled and licensed (fake or otherwise), must pay 5 resources a month as a lifestyle cost, rather than 3.
