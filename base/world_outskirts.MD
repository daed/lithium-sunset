# Outskirts

Saint Louis, Missouri had long neglected to finish up cleaning up its radioactive material problem dating back to the Manhattan Project.  In the autumn of 2035, an underground landfill fire on the Western side of the city reached the poorly contained nuclear waste buried there and burned the fuel, releasing toxic gas into the air.  The eastwardly wind blanketed the dust across the city and river (and the farmland in Illinois).

The dust left much of the area uninhabitable, though in most cases it wasn't immediately fatal.  However, people panicked and began hoarding supplies.  Those who could left, and those who couldn't or wouldn't tried to go back to things as normal, but the chaos and damage were done.  There was a drastic spike in crime.  Businesses shut down.  Property value in the city had plummeted.  There became a food and water shortage.  After a while, people started getting sick and dying.  Soon those left behind became more seldom and seclusive, and the majority of the city was looted, and the carcass was left to rot.

The Outskirts are a section of relatively unradiated land on the southwest side of Saint Louis.  This area was lucky enough to avoid most of the immediate contamination, and with radiation medicine and a geiger counter, it is reasonably safe to live in (in a horrible sort of way).

## Corporate Presences

Most major corporations moved any real operations out of Saint Louis after the contamination spread, though Zennit has a strong presence.

## Location

##### "Zennit Town"
After diverting the Interstate further south around the city itself, Zennit continues to run a major logistics hub out of the Outskirts in an area that used to be Festus, Missouri.  A sprawl of cheaply improvised houses was constructed by its warehouse workers and grows out from around its fenced yards in all directions.  Lacking any official recognization, the town is often referred to as "Zennit Town" by most people.

Zennit Town is largely made of corrugated steel panels, cheap wood, and tarps.  Some of the luckier inhabitants might have a shipping container they share with a roommate.  Vehicles are uncommon, and Zennit runs a bus system through a major street along the sprawl.  

Grocery stores are nonexistent here, save for ZennitStands that offer convenience goods to the locals.  Crime is everywhere, and the night shift is well known to be one of the more dangerous ones.  A frequent tactic by the managerial staff to boost productivity is to threaten underperformers with reassignment to the night shift.

Something in the suburbs should be the constant movement of delivery drones.
