# The Grid

## Turn on, Jack in, Drop out

*A expressionless dark-skinned man sits staring out the window of a brick building.  Passerbys seen through the gaps of the fire escape trudge through their commutes along the street far below.  His perch is an old brown recliner stained dark in many places.  Several tears in the fabric decorate its top and back.  Its upholstery tacks (that hadn’t fallen out) had tarnished between age and neglect.  A military-replica backpack covered in handstitched repairs and modifications sat on the floor, leaning against the side of the chair.*

*He idly scratched his chest through a pink shirt that read “\<pop culture reference\>” while an eclectic jam of synthesized beats hammered out loudly through the room.  On his lap was a metal box almost the size of his leg, sporting a label denoting “Panasonic Grid Dervish ST-3 Cyberdeck”.  He’d had it custom ceraplated in neon yellow, bulletproof.  Across the surface were the words “BUY. TAKE. BREAK. THROW IT AWAY.” written in a black permanent marker.  Some cables were plugged into the box that ran to a polished metal port fixed to the side of his head, while others tethered into sockets adorning the wall.*

*Rafael's body in the real-world was dormant in that chair, but on the Grid, he was RIPOSTExMODERN, and he was hard at work.*

The Grid is a supermassive network spanning the globe that serves as a hub for the bulk of human interaction.  It is based upon the technology behind the early 21st century internet, but subsequent leaps and bounds in processing power and network throughput gave way to more data faster.  Humanity was able to utilize considerable processing power through their tiny handheld comsticks and it wasn’t much longer that humanity invented the Direct Neural Interface, or as it’s more frequently called, the Datajack.

The Datajack was originally designed for sufferers of paralysis and coma to be able to communicate with the outside world and soon after saw use in the construction of cybernetic prosthetics.  Both datajacks and cybernetics were quickly adopted by countless corporations, security forces, and governments for industrial and professional applications.  It wasn’t much longer before it started being marketed as the last word in high-end entertainment.

When a person wants to join the Grid, they must wear interface gear which usually includes a net of electrodes, glasses with video lenses, and hepatic gloves.  These are typically connected to ports on a commstick and provide an interface to be able to view and interact with the new digital world.  Those most dedicated to the Grid (some would say obsessed) go so far as to opt for invasive surgery, implanting electrodes and an interface called a datajack directly into their skulls.  These extreme measures grant the users a much more immersive and lifelike experience, but the technology is so new that the health effects are still largely unknown.

## Everybody’s Doing It

Virtually everyone uses the Grid, but not to the same extreme.  Even “off the Grid”, a person without a comstick would struggle to survive without a way to be able to buy even the most basic goods and services.  They serve as identification for security personnel, rent-a-cops, or anyone else who would like to look.  When they connect to the Grid, most people use electrodes and gloves with their comsticks, because the hardware is cheap and readily available.  Power users such as security forces, deckers, enthusiast gamers, and simstreamers tend to have integrated (and expensive) datajacks in their heads that provide a completely immersive solution when paired with a cyberdeck.

## One World or Another
Joining the Grid is a total sensory overload, even without a datajack.  The neural interface created with electrodes and a comstick provides constant sensation data, while hepatic gloves and goggles create real-time feedback.  On top of that, most location nodes and entertainment services have feedback cranked to attention-shattering levels that makes it seem almost more real than real life.  This makes doing tasks in the real world exceptionally more difficult.  When on the Grid, real-world tasks that would be routine almost always require effort, and any action depending upon a skill must be done at half the total bonus (rounded down) that the character would otherwise have.  A common public service announcement to see is “Don’t Dive and Drive, Arrive Alive!” often featuring Peter Pedestrian, a cartoon character with a large black tread mark across his chest and exes for eyes.

The total immersion of the cyberdeck makes it even more difficult for a decker to be able to focus on the real world while jacked in.  On top of that, they are subjected to the same concentration-robbing distractions that a comstick user would be, but now they are fired directly into the brain via deep tissue implants with breathtaking throughput.  It takes a very deliberate effort to move one’s body intentionally at all, and tasks that would normally be routine instead require effort if they are even possible.  In order to act in the real world while jacked in, a user must first pass an ```Disengage (Will) 13``` test.  Even then, any action depending upon a skill must be done at half the total bonus (rounded down) that the character would otherwise have.

No matter which method a character uses to join the Grid, they are always aware of the priori, which are a few facts about their current situation.  These facts are always available, and the only thing the character must to do to know the answer is to think the question to themselves:
- They know if they are connected to the Grid or if they are experiencing the real-world
- They know what they are seeing and any physical sensations in the real-world
- They know the time and date and how long they’ve been connected
- They know how much longer they have until their battery runs out (if applicable)

The priori will typically manifest in a metaphor of the grid.  The time and date might be a visual indicator, such as a watch or heads-up-display.  If they check on what they’re seeing, it might appear as a data window playing a streaming video of footage from their eyes.  Unlike most other Grid metaphor, the priori can be private to the character, or it could be something they share with others.

## There’s No Node Like Home

Anything and everything on the Grid is referred to as a Node.  A Node is the underlying entity providing a sensory representation of itself, be it a user, device, program, data, or server.

User nodes are software packages that run on a comstick or cyberdeck that allow users to create a representation of themselves in the Grid.  This information is one part of their Persona, the sum of data collected by corporations through tracking and data mining that serves as identification.  Users have nearly limitless avenues for customization, though a handful of rules are imposed by most civilized locations.  These rules prevent users from appearing as objects or being of an incompatible size with the rest of the connected Nodes.  

When a user joins the Grid, they go to their own location node.  This is a private (invite only) location on the grid that exists on their comstick.  This can look however the user would like it to.   From this point on they may connect out through nodes along the grid.  Most travel is nearly instantaneous, but only if you know where you are going.  Looking for something can take quite a while.

Cyberdecks are a little different.  When a user uses a datajack and cyberdeck to connect to an access point, they still have their home node, but they can only leave into the location node they connected into.  They can connect to other nodes from there, but that is dependent on circumventing the security of the node and may require defeating ICE or, worse, corporate security deckers. 

## Cyberdecks

### Stats
Stat values are used to determine speed of operation

Higher values go first during combat

The number of rounds an action takes to complete is determined by the test difficulty divided by the cyberdeck stat rounded down.

|Stats| Associated Skills|
|-----|------------------|
|Throughput | Wreck, Crack|
|Firewall   | Defy, Lurk|
|Processor  | Sift, Operate|


### Traits

Like a player, a cyberdeck might also have a special trait representing a mod, characteristic, or quirk of that particular device.
