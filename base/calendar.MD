# Calendar

Days pass by preciously as the cogs of civilization tirelessly grinds them down.  This section includes rules for using a calendar to track time spent in game.  This is useful for keeping an eye on when rent is due, as well as to track the time spent designing and building gear.  These rules are optional but recommended.

## Events

Events come in two forms, random and fixed.  Fixed events happen regularly and routinely.  Lifestyle upkeep is a fixed event.  An unexpected breakdown is a random event.

A random event should occur at least once a month per character, and the GM should choose when and what the event is in secret.

Both types of Events are listed in detail below.

### Random Events

### Fixed Events

#### Lifestyle Upkeep, 1st of Month

Rent is due on the first, and by then your other bills are either past due from last month, or quickly approaching from this month.  Either way, you need to pay your lifestyle cost in resources to maintain it for another month.  This cost includes all fees and taxes required to exist at the lifestyle you are living at.  Failure to pay it for two or more months reduces your lifestyle by one category immediately.  This includes potential eviction and having vehicles repossessed.
