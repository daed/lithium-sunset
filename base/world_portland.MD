# Portland

Portland's seen a rough few years, but it's still standing.  Amazon-TimeWarner controls most of Washington State to the north, and long since eyed expansion into Portland.  They maintain a presence there, but as of yet political control is still in the hands of a local collective.

Between the housing boom and the increasing homeless population (completely unrelated, according to local media), industrialization came swift and sudden.  Condos became studio apartments, houses became apartments.  The Corporations bought up all of the real estate, and housing immediately became inexpensive, in good supply, and awful.  Apartments stretched into blocks, massive homogenous arrays of human-boxes.  Building quality became questionable, and soundproofing a premium.  

As an 'environmentally conscious initiative', corporations began offering subsidies to employees for the apartments closer to their offices.  This created a strong geographical class divide.  Some neighborhoods improved, but most worsened.  This also created additional economic burden for employees looking to seek employment at a competitor, forming the beginning of the ideal wageslave.

#### Arcohabs

As crime (and the media coverage on crime) intensified, 'ArcoHabs' started becoming a prominent fixture in the city.  Designed to safely and efficiently relocate workers closer to their toil while eliminating the messy distractions of the outside world, the Acrohabs are monolithic structures that run three city blocks wide on a side and includes any amenity an average corp drone would need.  Each floor has work offices, cafeterias, gyms, and theaters, with minor variations from floor to floor.  They are a very upscale, sleek, and modern way to live, according to the sales brochures you'll find in the lobby office.

In reality they're claustrophobic and sterile feeling and remind one of living in a cage.  There are lists of rules and regulations.  The only store is the company store, and leaving is a headache.  But they're usually safe and clean and there's a type of person who is happy living a life so managed.

#### Stark Street

Stark is an unassuming one-way street that has a two-block stretch of restaurants, window shops, and bars.  It is a rarity among the increasingly corporate-controlled city blocks.

##### Specific Locations

AVARICE is a popular hangout for deckers and mercenary-types.  It offers a moody low-key barroom, booths with Grid Access Points, and bartenders who don't ask a lot of questions.  The security 

On the other end of the spectrum, ```taste``` is an establishment operated by a Nowist named Chirag Anand.  As a more practical-than-average Nowist, he allows the use of comsticks to pay your tab, but does not permit their use otherwise in his restaurant.  In spite of this, it remains popular in a novel sort of way.  Though many turn a nose up to it as being quaint and old fashioned, his menu remains highly recommended by food critics, even if they have to wait until they leave to go online to actually submit the recommendations.
