# Portland

Portland's seen a rough few decades, but it's still standing.  Zennit controls most of Washington State to the north, and long since eyed expansion into Portland.  They maintain a presence there, but as of yet political control is still in the hands of a local collective.

Between the housing boom and the increasing homeless population (completely unrelated, according to local media), miniaturization came swift and sudden.  Condos became studio apartments, houses became apartments.  The Corporations bought up all of the real estate, and housing immediately became inexpensive, in good supply, and awful.  Apartments stretched across entire city blocks like massive homogenous arrays of human-boxes.  Building quality became questionable, and soundproofing became a premium.  

As an 'environmentally conscious initiative', corporations began offering subsidies to employees for the apartments closer to their offices.  This created a strong geographical class divide.  Some neighborhoods improved, but most worsened.  This also created additional economic burden for employees looking to seek employment at a competitor, forming the beginning of the ideal wageslave.

#### The Arcohabs

As crime (and the media coverage on crime) intensified, 'ArcoHabs' started becoming a prominent fixture in the city.  Designed to safely and efficiently relocate workers closer to their toil while eliminating the messy distractions of the outside world, the Acrohabs are monolithic structures that run three city blocks wide on a side and includes any amenity an average corp drone would need.  Each floor has work offices, cafeterias, gyms, and theaters, with minor variations from floor to floor.  They are a very upscale, sleek, and modern way to live, according to the sales brochures you'll find in the lobby office.

In reality they're claustrophobic and sterile feeling and remind one of living in a cage.  There are lists of rules and regulations.  The only store is the company store, and leaving is a headache.  But they're usually safe and clean and there's a type of person who is happy living a life so managed.

## Notable Information

#### Crime
Crime skyrocketed in Portland.  SPARTAN and its predecessors had long been traveling to Portland to look for trouble.  Policing has become so unreliable that apartment and office facilities often secure their own private security personnel.  

## Locations

#### Prohaska Dome

Prohaska Dome is a beheometh of a structure that spans four city blocks to a side.  It is the world headquarters of Prohaska and is designed to be a completely self-sufficient habitat for its employees.

Virtually a city in its own regard, about half of the dome is dedicated to living quarters and cafeterias, gyms, and theaters, while the other half used for offices and the immense data centers required to maintain the Grid.

A small army of security personnel is staged at Prohaska Dome at all times.  In the event of a terrorist attack, the dome can go into total lockdown, turning into a veritable fortress.

Prohaksa controls almost all grid access in the Portland area.  Most Portland citizens use Prohaksa as their Grid service.  

#### Stark Street

Stark is an unassuming one-way street that has a two-block stretch of restaurants, window shops, and bars.  It is a rarity among the increasingly corporate-controlled city blocks.

##### Specific Locations

AVARICE is a popular hangout for deckers and mercenary-types.  It offers a moody low-key barroom, booths with Grid Access Points, and bartenders who don't ask a lot of questions.  The security 

On the other end of the spectrum, ```taste``` is an establishment operated by a Nowist named Chirag Anand.  As a more practical-than-average Nowist, he allows the use of comsticks to pay your tab, but does not permit their use otherwise in his restaurant.  In spite of this, it remains popular in a novel sort of way.  Though many turn a nose up to it as being quaint and old fashioned, his menu remains highly recommended by food critics, even if they have to wait until they leave to go online to actually submit the recommendations.
