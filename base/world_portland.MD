# Portland

Portland's seen a rough few years, but it's still standing.  Amazon-TimeWarner controls most of Washington State to the north, and long since eyed expansion into Portland.  They maintain a few offices there, but as of yet political control is still in the hands of a local collective.

#### Arcohabs

As crime (and the reporting on crime) intensified, 'ArcoHabs' started becoming a prominent fixture in the city.  Designed to safely and efficiently relocate workers closer to their toil while eliminating the messy distractions of the outside world, the Acrohabs are monolithic structures that run three city blocks wide on a side and includes any amenity an average corp drone would need.  Each floor has work offices, cafeterias, gyms, and theaters, with minor variations from floor to floor.  They are a very upscale, sleek, and modern way to live, according to the sales brochures you'll find in the lobby office.

In reality they're clausterphobic and sterile feeling and remind one of living in a cage.  There are lists of rules and regulations.  The only store is the company store, and leaving is a headache.  But they're usually safe and clean and there's a type of person who is happy living a life so managed.

#### Stark Street

Stark is an unassuming one-way street that has a three-block stretch of small restaurants, window shops, and bars.  

AVARICE is a popular hangout for deckers and mercenary-types.
