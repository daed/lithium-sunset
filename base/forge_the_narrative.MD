# Forge the Narrative

This is a list of prompts intended to help write some 'slice of life' pieces to better flesh out the world.

How do people go get a cup of... Nulcaf or whatever?  What do they worship?  What does grocery shopping look like?  How do they fuck?

It's all just quick scenes designed to provide a bit of atmosphere.

## coffee

In 2065, in the SW Portland area, in the Arcohab district, Steve stepped off of autobus 22A onto the bus platform of 122nd Street, B level.  B level was a construction of bridges and platforms about 120 feet in the air running between the arcohabs like a giant, interconnected set of treehouses wrought of concrete and steel.  The 'habs are so large that it stopped making sense to go to the ground to get on a bus because it wasn't worth the travel, so they instead brought busses into the skies.  This floor was the highest that wasn't fully enclosed, and in spite of wind blocks, was still quite windy.  Steve snatched for his hat just as an errant breeze started to lift it off of his head.  His glasses flashed a green arrow on the lens, indicating to him which path he was supposed to take. 

This street was kind of out of his way, but his favorite Nulcaf shop was here.  Steady increases in temperature over the last few decades had shrunk the amount of land where coffee could be grown, until it became an expensive rarity few could afford.  Nulcaf was a popular brand of synthetic coffee.  It was mostly made from soy and mushrooms, though it was heavily fortified with taurine, guanine, and various other -ines that will "face fuck your thirst", according to the tagline on the cans of it that you can buy from vending machines.  The hot stuff was where it was at for Steve though, and that was much harder to track down.  Coffee gets hard to find after the wage slaves go home for the night.

Steve stopped along the walk and turned to look at the facade of the storefront on the side of the 'hab here.  The sign on the wall read Crashcourse Psuedocof (for legal reasons they couldn't actually *call* any synthetic coffee '*coffee*', so coffee vendors had to either resort to awkward nomenclature like 'Psuedocof' or avoid using the term altogether).  

The sign on the wall was a few pieces of wood bolted together with the name of the store carefully painted on.  It looked like someone spent an afternoon putting it together.  In reality, there were over 20 focus groups on the precise design of the store sign, including fine tuning the specific color of paint and finding the perfect width in the gap between each board.  Over a thousand man-hours went into that sign to carefully reproduce the ideal mental image of what a sign outside of a small family-owned coffee shop might look like.  A master-craft in veneers of authenticity.  It probably has at least one paper written about it.  Crashcourse has signs that are 100% identical to this one at all of their locations, 30 of which were in this 'hab alone, but Steve didn't know any of this.  He just wanted his fix and he wanted it fast.

The door opened to a cramped entryway room.  A message appeared in Steve's lenses showing the logo of Optrix Security and the words "Weapons, explosives, and drugs are not permitted in Crashcourse Pseudocof".  Several beams of light spun around Steve.  A few seconds later a green light came on and the interior door slide open, and Steve was on his way inside. 

Stepping inside the shop, various ads and menus sprung to life on the screens in his lenses.  The inside was slightly larger than the entryway, with chairs designed to be comfortable enough to sit in, but not comfortable enough to way to stay in.  An older man in a suit and overcoat sat in one of them, sipping his glass.  Steve walked up to the counter and the woman standing there enthusiastically exclaimed, "Welcome to Crashcourse!  What rush would you like to go on today?"  This was the standard corporate-approved greeting, and it had clearly been rehearsed many, many times.  The name tag on her all-black uniform read "Nova".

"Nova, I'd like a Nulcaf 300 with foam, and can I get a shot of Jolt in there too?"  The man in the overcoat shot a glance at Steve.  Jolt was a low strength amphetamine that had been legalized over a decade ago.  It was a popular addition to drinks, but surprisingly few places actually carried it regularly.  

As he spoke the words, he saw his order display across the lenses of his glasses.  He didn't actually have to communicate with her.  At all.  He didn't even have to open his mouth.  He could have just done it on his comstick and forgone the interaction altogether.  But he comes here because there *is* still someone you can give your order to directly.  At most places you can't even talk to a human if you want to.

Upon finishing speaking his order, a total appeared.  He reached up and tapped an accept button floating in the air just under the total, the tiny motors in his glove giving a vibrating *pulse* as it registers the button's presence.  A happy little jingle emitted from somewhere near the counter.

"Mmm-hmmmm, I'll get right on it," she sung happily.  Or at least, tried to.  It sounded very forced, and she looked tired.  

Steve stood around waiting until she returned to the counter with a steaming paper cup containing 300ml of something vaguely resembling coffee in smell and color.  She stuck a pipette into a bottle and dispensed a small amount of liquid into the top of the cup and deftly followed it up with a chrome apparatus that sprayed a layer of foam (also mostly soy) over the top of the beverage.  "You need to finish before the cup gets cold otherwise the Jolt will lose potency."  She slid the cup across the counter to him.

"Thanks, see ya next time", and Steve was out the door.

## cooking
 
In 2065, in southern Old Chicago, in a shoddy apartment complex, in a cramped 15" x 15" room, a woman in her late 20s lies as sprawled out as an adult can get on a twin bed.  Her black hair was a flattened mop beneath her head; the metallic gleam of an electrode net on her head was visible through the many strands.  She was wearing a shiny black robe that puddled around her on the bed, but she hadn't noticed.  She was too distracted by an electronically induced sense of flying.  It was cold in the room, but she hadn't noticed.  She was shivering from the *electronically induced* sense of cold.  Under her bed was a set of rolling drawers that served as her dresser.  Along the wall next to her head was a counter running toward the opposite wall.  The leaking sink reported from atop the counter.  To the foot of the bed, there was a sliding door leading to a balcony.  Wrought iron adorned the glass on the door, and a two by four was slid in place along the track, rendering it immobile.  A soiled couch ran along the opposite wall, and a walk-in closet on the far corner had been converted into a room with shower and toilet.  The smell of mold stagnated, particularly around a cluttered heap of cookbooks and notes that was deposited on the floor.  The walls were covered in a white, chalky paint that kind of felt like it stuck to your fingers when you touched it, except for where the phrase "FUCK THIS PLACE" was spray-painted across the entirety of one wall in DuPont-3M Krypton black high gloss enamel.  Five gallon jugs of water consume the floorspace, leaving behind only neat paths indicating which corners of the apartment were worth the owner's attention.  

The carpet was flat, the heating was out, and the disposition was bleak.  The walls were infested.  There was no kitchen.  When the water was running, you still didn't want to drink it.  You probably shouldn't bathe in it or wash your dishes in it either, but Katherine still did those things.  It tastes like rotten eggs and catches fire *too* well.  Katherine just kind of wanted to die every minute she spent staring at this bleak walls.  But on the Grid, Katherine owns a house on the side of a mountain.  It's spacious and clean and organized.  The water comes straight off of the mountain glacier.  Most of the walls were glass, but the ones that remained were painted vibrant blues.  

Katherine's avatar hurtled through the neon expanse of the grid at breathtaking speed, landing precisely just outside the nodespace for the Anytime Grocer's storefront.  Her crew has a job staking out the guard rotation outside a Minerva Laboratories facility for a client and their leader, ```total_relapse```, had tasked her with the supply run.  Hey, every role is important, no matter how small.  Besides, she was happy to help with anything that could hurt Minerva in *any* way.  Anytime had a store close to her apartment, so she'll just order on the grid and ride her skateboard there.  Her order should be ready for pick-up about the time she got there.  

She walked through the gleaming portal onto the Anytime Grocer's node, and was immediately dropped into the middle of a sprawling grocery store with isles that stretched out toward the horizon.  Gleaming ads for various services and products erupted across every surface of the storefront that wasn't a product itself, each with their own unique flourishes of color and sound.  With a look of disgust, she turned on a visual filter that their resident hacker had made for her and the ads at once turned silent and translucent.  The battle between advertisers and humanity was a losing one, but individual victories could still be won.

Without really needing to wander around or browse, she found each product one at a time on the shelves at the very moment she thought of it.  The experience gave the illusion of travelling through the store, but she didn't really need to walk around.  She didn't really need to look behind other products or at the tags under bare shelves (there would have had to be bare shelves).  She didn't even need to push her cart around with her; whenever she needed to put something into it, it was always within arms reach nearby.

Her day job is as a chef in a mid-range restaurant that caters to well off wage slaves.  This is a lengthy stakeout, so she'll be ordering ration bars and bags of chips for the team, but the first meal of the job is gonna be on her; one goddamned real meal.  If she's going to do it, she's going to do it right.  The grocery store moiréd and dissolved as she ripped the electrode net off of her head.  Pausing for a second to adjust to the sudden sense of motion sickness, she got up and proceeded to get dressed.  She shrugged off the black synthread robe she was barely kind of wearing and she tossed it onto her bed.  Then she took some canvas pants and an old tshirt out of a dresser and slipped them on.  Finally she put a synthread windbreaker.  On her way out the door, she grabbed her skateboard and slung a large backpack onto her back that she expected she could fit all the groceries into.

After about a half-hour, she was back from picking up the ingredients.  She chopped several types of onion and cubed some tofu on a plastic cutting board with an old chef's knife.  The knife was from her grandmother from the old pre-grid days, manufactured by a medium-sized company that was bought out and dismantled by an investment firm.  The company, Tanaka-Blade, kept a positive balance, but accountants had determined there was more profit to be had in selling the company's assets and brand off, piece-meal.  The pre-grid knives became somewhat of a collector's item between chefs and cooking enthusiasts, though they weren't especially valuable.

She pulled out a tank of propane and a burner and sat them out on the concrete walk of her balcony.  She normally cooked out here since she didn't have a stove in the apartment.  There was just no room for one.  She lit the burners and then a joint, and then put water on to boil and began stir frying the vegetables and tofu.  While those were cooking, she went back inside to gather other jars and bottles of ingredients to add.

Before much longer, she had 12 servings of her Spicy Tofu Udon ready to go in sealed plastic containers.  That should be enough for two servings for each of the crew, herself included.  Anyone could bring food to a stakeout, but not everyone could bring *hot and fresh noodle soup*.  It was about that time she received a ping on her comstick.  She glanced at it to see a map of ```relapse```'s location at an office building near where she supposed the Minerva facility was.  She loaded the soup up into the backpack along with the pile of ration bars and other food she'd bought for the stakeout and headed for the door.  On her way to the rail-station, she made a joke to herself about 'steak outs'.  Chef humor.

## detectives
A camera records grainy afterimages of a building onto photosensitive tape.  The images are a negative of a scene containing a building on a poorly illuminated night.  The scene is being drown with rain.  My avatar was standing there, soaking in the endless rain.  There's a body on the ground before me, in a pool of blood, rapidly cooling in the winter night.  The body belonged to a client of mine.  Not an active case, but I liked the guy.  His body didn't have much to go off of.  Single shot to the chest, dead within a couple minutes.  His wallet wasn't missing.  No message or propaganda or calling card.  Polaris Security's goons were chalking it up to a failed burglary, and that could be what it is, but it just doesn't feel right, ya know?

A man in a ill-fitting but fashionable suit sat in a chair in an office with a 00 gauge conduit running out of the side of his head.  That's me for real.  I suppressed the noir murder scene to pull a cheap bottle of whisky out of the drawer.  I attempted to pour it into a glass with poor results.  It shouldn't have been surprising when it spilled, given how shaky my hands were, but it was.  I didn't bother to dig the last cigarette out of the pack before smashing it tight in my fist and hurling it into the trash with a frustrated and loud "FUUUUCK!"  In case you hadn't figured, the client's dead for real too, and I am extremely unhappy about that.  I'm trying to do something *about it* but evidence is shaky.  I had hacked Polaris Security and copied the evidence collected from the scene of the murder.  The software on my cyberdeck lets me reconstruct the image from the police photos of the crime scene into a holographic form.  It's not perfect and there's gaps, but it's still better than nothing.  Just makes it seem like the rain is harder, and it was already a rainy night that night.

The murder was just reported two days ago.  His wife called me and asked me to look into it.  Said she didn't know who else to go to.  I made an appointment with her for tomorrow, and tonight I'm building a preliminary report.  Tomorrow I'll (probably) tell her what I found, and then she can tell me how she wants to handle this.  He was a 'Special Relationship Manager' at a subsidiary of Prohaska.  That means he was paid to find and hire dangerous men to do things off the books like a cover up or espionage.  I dunno how much she knows about that.  I was in a similar field and we did business.  I'm no killer, but I've got an eye for detail and a background with the coppers, so I'm nice to have around when you need that kinda thing.  I'm a detective.  Private Contractor.  We're a dying breed but we're still out here.
