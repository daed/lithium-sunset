# Core Rules
## Player Characters
### Tabula Rasa:  Become A New You, Today!

```<some sexy flavor text here>```

### Abilities and Action Skills

An ability score is a value representing how potent certain attributes of your character are.  Typically these range from 1 to 6, though they can be modified by stims, damage, and special effects.  Human average for each attribute is 3, and over 90% of most humans will be between 2 and 4.  A score lower than 1 leaves a character unconscious until they recover from whatever has cause it, while getting a score higher than 6 is not naturally possible.

The ability score value is used as a bonus to any associated skills, and also serves as a cap for those skills.  A skill value cannot be increased greater than the corresponding ability score.  Unless otherwise stated, bonuses provided to skills do not interact with the skill cap.

### Attribute examples

Here are some example values for a Strength score and what they imply about the character:

|Score | Who would have it |
|------|-------------------|
|  0   | A coma patient in a hospital |
|  1   | Someone debilitated or permanently bedridden|
|  2   | A malnourished person who works a desk job |
|  3   | Human Average |
|  4   | Someone who exercises regularly / light cybernetics user |
|  5   | A dedicated body-builder|
|  6   | A world-class athlete / very heavy cybernetics user |
|  7+   | Beyond natural human limits |

### Knowledge Skills

In the future, knowledge is power, even more than it is now.  In addition to the active skills above, a character possesses knowledge skills.  These are special skills that don't accomplish an action but instead inform the character of elements in the world.  They can be used to obtain more information on pertinent topics, provide background into subject material, or be used as a basis for designing and building equipment.  Much as there is no complete list of possible topics to be knowledgeable about in the real world, there is also no complete list of Knowledge Skills.  The list below is provided as a good starting point, but players should work with their GMs to determine which ones will be relevant to their characters and the game.

When using a Knowledge skill, a character adds their skill with a mental attribute corresponding with what they're seeking to use the knowledge for.  If they are convincing another of their knowledge, then they would add Charm.  If they are trying to recall facts about the knowledge, they would add Will.  If they're trying to apply the knowledge in a practical sense, such as in craft, they would add Wits.  If the use case doesn't fit any of these, then select one that makes the most sense for the way the knowledge is being applied.

A character's skill cap for knowledge skills is the highest of their Wits, Will, or Charm attributes.

#### Example Knowledge Skills
- Gangs
- Drugs/Pharmaceuticals
- Politics
- Technology
- Military/Security
- Street
- Corporate Etiquette
- History
- Economics
- Engineering
- Business
- Culture (specific, examples: Grid Sports, 20th Century Music, Gutterpunk Fashion, Vintage Hollywood)
- Language (specific, examples:  English, Spanish, 'Gridspeak', Russian)

### Skill Tests

The outcome of most actions are driven by skill tests.  Skill tests represent your character attempting to do a non-routine or unrepeatable task as well as routine tasks performed while distracted or under duress.  Using a firearm is a skill test.  Hacking a system is several skill tests,  depending on security and what the objective is.  Driving to the store for a carton of soymilk probably isn’t unless the character doesn’t know how to drive or is being attacked by ninjas (or conditions are somehow otherwise adverse).

When written out, a skill test looks like this:

```Pilot (Dexterity) 10```

This means that the Pilot skill (which is Dexterity based) should be used, and the difficulty of the test is 10.  In order to attempt the test, the player needs to roll 2d6 (two six sided dice), and add them together with their Dexterity attribute and Pilot skill.  If all four of those add up to 10 or more, then they’ve passed the test and succeeded at piloting whatever vehicle they’re trying to operate.  If they fail, then the GM determines the consequences of failure.  This could be as trivial as getting lost and the trip takes longer, or as catastrophic as causing a major accident.  This is up to the GM (and common sense), but generally a lower result should have more dire consequences.  Rolling two 1’s should probably always count as a catastrophic failure, and two 6’s should count as an amazing success, provided that the task was possible to fail or succeed at in the first place.


### Health

#### Hitpoints and Hitboxes

<div class="sidebar" markdown="1">

|Hitboxes |
|---------|
|Head     |
|Right arm|
|Left arm |
|Torso    |
|Groin    |
|Right leg|
|Left leg |

</div>

A hitbox is a specific location on a character that can take damage.  Each hitbox has two hitpoints by default.  This may be modified by traits, cybernetics, body armor or other characteristics.  The hitboxes present on a normal unmodified human are listed in the sidebar.  The overwhelming majority of all characters will have these, but cybernetics, injuries, or other events may add or remove hitboxes as well to a character's list.

At one hitpoint remaining, a hitbox is considered injured.  It may continue to be used, but any test depending on it (GM discretion) only receives half of the modifier from skills or traits, rounded down (unless otherwise specified).  A resist pain test may be attempted before a skill test (at the same difficulty) in order to receive the full bonus.

At zero hit points remaining, a hitbox is too hurt to use properly.  All skill tests requiring the use of this hitbox (GM discretion) will fail.  Due to extreme pain, ANY test performed by the character only receives half of the modifier from skills or traits, rounded down (unless otherwise specified).  A resist pain test may be attempted before a skill test (at the same difficulty) in order to receive the full bonus.  In addition, the character is at risk of bleeding out.

<div class="sidebar" markdown="1">
### Sensitive Spots

Some hitboxes are more sensitive to injury than others.  

A head or groin injury requires the character to pass a Blackout (Fortitude) 12 test to stay conscious.  (A character with a hitbox at negative hitpoints doesn’t need to make an additional test for this because they will also need to make one per the rules below).  

A groin at negative hit points increases the difficulty of the Blackout test by 1.  This permanent injury may also inflict severe trauma not reflected here.

A torso or head at negative hit points results in death of that character.
</div>

At -1 hit points remaining, a hitbox is destroyed or mangled beyond triage.  This injury cannot be treated outside of a medical center or other comparable facility staffed by competent personnel.  All skill tests requiring the use of this hitbox fail.  Due to extreme pain, ANY test performed by the character only receives half of the modifier from skills.  This character is at risk of bleeding out and must also pass a ```Blackout (Fortitude)``` test (difficulty = 10 + total missing hitpoints) every minute to stay conscious.  Only one such test must be performed each minute.


#### Bleeding Out

A character with at least two points of damage is at risk of bleeding out.  Each turn they must make an Endurance (Fortitude) 7 test to keep from bleeding out.  Keep track of how many rounds elapse, and increase the difficulty of this check by one each round.  A failure results in another point of damage done to one of the hitboxes (player’s choice).

The player may (if conscious) ignore bleeding out for a round by taking no other strenuous action other than walking. This represents the character taking time to apply direct pressure to wounds to slow the bleeding.  Each round spent avoiding bleeding in this way doesn’t increase the difficulty of the Endurance test above.

The wounded character (or an ally) may apply first aid to stop the bleeding.  If this is done then the character is not at risk for bleeding out any more until they take another point of damage.  See the Healing skill description for more information.

### Character Creation

```NOTE: This is a basic method of generating a average character, fresh faced and ready to go.  This character creation process is a little static, but I will hopefully be able to improve on it as time goes on. ```

#### Bonus Points

All characters have 5 bonus points.  They may spend these freely throughout the character creation process to further customize their characters beyond the defaults.  Rules for using them will be detailed in each section.  Any bonus points not spent at the end are converted into credits at 200 credits per bonus point.

#### Attributes

All characters start with 19 points to allocate between attributes.  They may do this as they see fit, though they cannot have more than one attribute outside of the 2-4 range.

One attribute may be increased for 4 bonus points.  This increase may raise an attribute above 4 regardless of the above rule.  This selection may only be taken once regardless of the number of bonus points a character might have.

#### Action Skills

All character start with 10 active skill points.  A character can distribute these skill points between skills however they wish, though they must abide by the ability score cap.

Bonus points may be spent on additional skill points at a rate of 1 bonus point for 1 skill point.  These increases may only be in skills that already have at last one skill point in them.  Up to 5 bonus points may be spent this way.

#### Knowledge Skills

All characters may start with 4 Knowledge skills.  Each Knowledge skill selected at character creation starts with 2 ranks.  These skills may be increased in the game later on.

In addition, a character may select a single language knowledge skill to be their native tongue.  This is a knowledge skill for them with 4 points in it.

Bonus points may be spent on additional skill points at a rate of 1 bonus point for 1 skill point.  Unlike Action Skills, new knowledge skills may be purchased in this way, though they only start at rank 1.  Up to 5 bonus points may be spent this way.

#### Traits

A character may select a single positive trait from the ones allowed from the Traits section.  

A character may gain 5 bonus points by selecting a negative trait from the ones allowed.  This may only happen once.

A second positive trait may be purchased for 5 bonus points.  This selection may only be taken once regardless of the number of bonus points a character might have.

#### Money

A character starts with 20000 credits worth of gear.  Up to 2000 credits may be kept from this amount.  Any unspent credits beyond that are lost.

Bonus points may be spent on additional credits at a rate of 200 credits per bonus point.  Credits bought this way do not count toward the 2000 credit limit above.

### Character Features

#### Verve
Every character gets 2 Verve at character creation.  This represents a reservoir of supernatural luck, spontaneous reality alignment, a previously unrevealed contingency, or some other *je ne sais quoi* that they can leverage in the most dire moments to turn the tide.  By spending one, the player can select one of the following effects to apply to the game:

Reroll one or both dice in a skill test the player’s character just failed
Force an npc to reroll both dice in a skill test the npc just attempted (pass or fail)
Delay a source of death for one round (automatic if the player’s character is about to die)

Unless otherwise stated, only one Verve may be spent per player per game session.  The only regular exception to this is when spending Verve to delay death; this is done automatically and only stops when the character runs out of Verve or is resuscitated by another character.

Verve is a powerful and useful means of injecting a twist into the game.  It should not be used lightly, and the player and GM should work together to develop a reason this surprise outcome occurred.  Additional Verve may be awarded by a GM for achieving major milestones, good role-playing, or other reasons, though a character should never have more than 2 Verve total at any time.
#### Traits

Players acquire traits that are modifiers on the character that represent physical changes, social obligations, or karmic fluctuations.  Traits can be bought (during character creation or advancement) or earned.  Some traits provide bonuses or alter abilities.  Not all traits are positive though, and they include negative qualities such as missing limbs or other lingering malalignments.  You may select a positive quality at character start.
