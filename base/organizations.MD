# Major Corporations and Groups

"You know, if one person, just one person, does it, they may think he's 
Really sick and they won't take him..."

"And if three people do it! Can you imagine three people walkin' in, singin' a bar of 'Alice's Restaurant' and walkin' out? They may think it's an organization!"

### Extremists

Toward the end of the Internet Age as Internet adoption hit its peak rate, a strange phenomenon occurred:  Online communities were turning into echo chambers.  This created feedback loops along particular political and philosophical axes that radicalized people toward violent and criminal ends.  The Internet turned into a place of misinformation and distrust, though that didn't slow anyone down.

##### SPARTAN

SPARTAN is a loosely affiliated collection of small organizations and clubs across the former US/Canada territory.  Often they are established and officially registered as shooting clubs or fraternal organizations.  SPARTAN itself, however, has no official registration.  Any organization may produce the insignia and declare themselves a part of it.  As such, even though most governments and corporations recognize it as a terrorist group, information about their strength and leadership is not well-established.

SPARTAN seeks the restoration of the former power and control of the US government.  Broad goals and sentiment are disseminated through propaganda channels publicly registered as "Fiction/Entertainment", while specific plans are discussed in private vidchats and on encrypted nodes.  The propaganda channels are then bankrolled through the individual members of the club, keeping them funded for any legal battles brought against them for slander or harassment.

SPARTAN actively generates and propagates misinformation.  The misinformation may be about any topic, and does not need to be internally consistent, though it will typically be laced with varying degrees of racial or nationalist overtones.  This is done to advance their agenda while eroding overall trust in the Grid.  People often dismissively accuse them of wanting to "violently turn back the clock to the 20th century."
