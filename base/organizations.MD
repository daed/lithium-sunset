# Major Corporations and Groups

"You know, if one person, just one person, does it, they may think he's 
Really sick and they won't take him..."

"And if three people do it! Can you imagine three people walkin' in, singin' a bar of 'Alice's Restaurant' and walkin' out? They may think it's an organization!"

### Extremists

Toward the end of the Internet Age as Internet adoption hit its peak rate, a strange phenomenon occurred:  Online communities were turning into echo chambers.  This created feedback loops along particular political and philosophical axes that radicalized people toward violent and criminal ends.  The Internet turned into a place of misinformation and distrust, though that didn't slow anyone down.

#### Specific Cells
##### SPARTAN

SPARTAN is a loosely affiliated collection of small organizations and clubs across the former US/Canada territory.  Often they are established and officially registered as shooting clubs or fraternal organizations.  SPARTAN seeks the restoration of the former power and control of the US government.  SPARTAN itself, however, has no official registration.  Any organization may produce the insignia and declare themselves a part of it.  As such, even though most governments and corporations recognize it as a terrorist group, information about their strength and leadership is not well-established.

Sometime around the late 20th century, people started to realize that if you could deliver a vague message to  Broad goals and sentiment are disseminated through propaganda channels publicly registered as "Fiction/Entertainment", while specific plans are discussed in private vidchats on encrypted nodes.  The propaganda channels are then bankrolled through 'donations' made by the individual members of the clubs, keeping them well funded for any legal battles brought against them for slander or harassment.

SPARTAN actively generates and propagates misinformation.  The misinformation may be about any topic, and does not need to be internally consistent, though it will frequently be laced with varying degrees of racial or nationalist overtone.  This is done to advance their agenda while eroding overall trust in the Grid.  Many speculate that they're trying to turn back the clock to the 20th century.

##### Choirboys

*They're all singing the same song and there's not a whole lot else going on upstairs.*

Choirboys are a recent development as of the mid 20th century.  They're people who are obsessed with a subculture to the point it has overtaken their personality.  The exact cause is unknown, but studies indicate a strong correlation with the overabundance of "lifestyle focused" advertising and political propaganda.  All things must relate to the subculture of the choirboy, and if it does not then it isn't real or doesn't matter.  If you try to convince them otherwise, they'll treat it like a personal attack.  News feeds and holovids are full of examples of their reactions and they're usually not pretty.

Choirboys aren't really an organization themselves necessarily, but often will form groups to 'advance the cause', 'spread the truth', or even just to get together to talk about whatever their obsession is.  Their interests vary radically from group to group, but the subject always centers around something that was a media sensation.  Conspiracy theories, historical pop fiction, and political parties are some of the larger ones, though there are always new ones forming.
