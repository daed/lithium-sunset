## So It Goes
*Anyone who told you that they couldn’t see the end coming has never been more wrong in their lives.  They just didn’t want to admit that this was all it took to push us over the brink.  The end started with unaddressed socio-economic tensions leading up to political dissent, threw in a viral explosion that was ignored and downplayed every step of the way, and then ended with the American Civil War.  It was a three-course apocalypse shoved straight down our throats, and we special ordered it super-size.*

*And it wasn’t just the US.  We tried our damnedest to be in the epicenter, you know, like we always do.  Heh.  Some people actually thought the virus was the Rapture up until they noticed how many Christians were still around.*

*But we rebuilt.  Well, the corporations rebuilt.  The Civil War had raged for so long and stretched the resources of the government so thin that they couldn’t manage the country on their own.  Out of desperation, they passed the Corporation Extraterritorial Emergency Jurisdictive Act which allowed corporations (or anyone if they had the cash) to pledge to take up running the local governments across the country in exchange for the tax revenue collected there.  It was meant to be a short term proposition, but it never ended and the US government was reduced to a paltry assortment of duties.  Lotta people think that’s great, and I’ll definitely say it’s better than the war was, but they never gave up control back to the government once they took it.  We wanted to go back to our old lives, but instead we found ourselves waking up to a New Normal.*

*That turned out about as well as you'd expect.  People tried to be hopeful at first, but unsurprisingly, the people and places that were already thriving developed and improved even more, and everyone else fell behind.  The corporations began see their power and influence increase tremendously, and expanded their territories as they consolidated and merged.  Entire states were subsumed in major corporate territories until only a few remain:  Cascascia, The SFS (Southwestern Federation of States), and the UCAS (United Canadian-American States)*.

# Reality Breakdown Effect

A strange phenomenon was observed in 2030 where a man was caught on video walking through a wall as if it wasn't there.  He was distracted by his comlink at the time and was looking down at it, rather than where he was going.  About 14 seconds later, he can be heard yelling and loudly pounding on the walls.  The entire wall needed to be excavated by construction personnel before he could escape.  The person later said that he wasn't paying attention and didn't realize the wall was there.  The video went viral and, while initially thought to be a hoax, was impossible to perfectly replicate.  

Such 'weird' events became more and more commonplace as the year continued, and a few hundred deaths and injuries were reported as a result, with the worst being a woman who walked into the wrong angle of a corner, vanishingly completely from reality.  Finally in 2031, Dr. Lorien Tor at Venturian Group had secured funding for her research into what came to be known as Reality Breakdown.

It took no sooner than this research becoming public before the conspiracy theories started, ranging anywhere from it being caused by the Grid, to it being similar to the Mandela effect, and some saying it was the work of an angry god.  Some Joker started a conspiracy theory that it was the deliberately caused by people who made conspiracy theories.  More than a handful of them accused Dr. Tor of causing them herself, and she had to get security after she began personally receiving threats.

After over a decade of research with little results, Dr. Tor finally had a minor breakthrough.
