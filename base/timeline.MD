## So It Goes
*Anyone who told you that they couldn’t see the end coming has never been more wrong in their lives.  They just didn’t want to admit that this was all it took to push us over the brink.  The end started with unaddressed socio-economic tensions leading up to political dissent, threw in a viral explosion that was ignored and downplayed every step of the way, and then ended with the American Civil War.  Three-course apocalypse shoved straight down our throats, and we special ordered it.*

*And it wasn’t just the US.  We tried our damnedest to be in the epicenter, you know, like we always do.  Heh.  Some people thought the virus was the Rapture up until they noticed how many Christians were still around.*

*But we rebuilt.  Well, the corporations rebuilt.  The Civil War had raged for so long and stretched the resources of the government so thin that they couldn’t manage the country on their own.  Out of desperation, they passed the Corporation Extraterritorial Emergency Jurisdictive Act which allowed corporations (or anyone if they had the cash) to pledge to take up running the local governments across the country in exchange for the tax revenue collected there.  It was meant to be a short term proposition, but it never ended and the US government was reduced to a paltry assortment of duties.  Lotta people think that’s great, and I’ll definitely say it’s better than the war was, but they never gave up control back to the government once they took it.  We wanted to go back to our old lives, but instead we found ourselves waking up to the New Normal.*
